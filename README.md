# Transcriber

Here is the transcriber that converts voice input to an audio file which further transcribes the audio to a text.
After converting the voice input to audio file, the file is named by a random code number that the user chooses.
If the user chooses the code 1, the audio file of speech input is saved as "1.flac"
Further the trascribed text content is stored in a text file named by the code as "1.txt".
